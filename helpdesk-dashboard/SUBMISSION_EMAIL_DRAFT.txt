Dear Recruitment Team,

I'm excited to submit my coding assignment for the Frontend Developer role. You can find the relevant links below:

**Technical Implementation Details:**
I focused heavily on building a component structure that is both scalable and clean. I chose to use `lucide-react` for the icons to match the crisp, linear aesthetic of the Dribbble design while keeping the bundle size small.

For the `TicketTable`, I spent extra time on the responsiveness—ensuring that text truncates correctly and layout shifts gracefully on smaller screens so a support agent could theoretically triage tickets from a tablet.

I also implemented a "Single Source of Truth" pattern in `App.jsx`, where the main state holds the ticket data and passes it down to the Dashboard and Table components. This ensures the stats cards always perfectly match the table data without synchronization bugs.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
